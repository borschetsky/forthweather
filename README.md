## Project improvement thoughts
Project can be improved with payed API from OpenWetherApp, and some design needed. 
I would add city search functionality. Switching from celsius to fahrenheit. 
Can be added more information about current wether and broadcasts, some graphics etc.

From the techical pars, as project growth, css modules or styled components can be used due to incapsulation and components reusability, same as a mobile ready functionality. 
Can be developed like PWA. 
At the moment there are no component drilling, in future can be added a Redux lib. to avoid component drillings. 

Project can grow to a very big one, so would be nice to use StoryBook to manage components. 
Would be nice to have a Unit tests.
Also would be nice to use TypeScript, to avoid runtime errors and for easy developing.
